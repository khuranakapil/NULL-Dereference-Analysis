1) Please import PAV18PublicTests  into eclipse.
2) Preferably create new run configurations for each test case. There will be five test cases.
3) Now the second argument will be the class containing main and the third argument will be the class containing the test case which will be different.
E.g. /home/stanley/Projects/e0227-null-dereference-analysis/PAV18PublicTests.jar LTestCases/PublicTests LTestCases/Test4 nullDerefTest
4) Please follow the expected format in the test cases. We have also provided the script (check_AlgoA.py) with which we will test your output. It takes as input two files; the reference and the result. References are given by us. Result would be your file.
Run  "python check_AlgoA.py referencefile resultfile"
